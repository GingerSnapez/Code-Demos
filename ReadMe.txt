Hi there! This is a description of three personal projects I have made in my free time in various ares of coding.

Frog Game:
A 2D platformer that I am making with my college roomate. It is in early stages of developement and has only baseline movement (including coyote time), animation, and collisions completed. It was made in game maker studio and we are currently porting it to unity to continue developement.

Text_Huffman_Compression:
A program that uses a text file as a key to create a huffman compression program and then compress/decompress another given text file using bit maniputaltion and a huffman tree. This was written with C in the mac terminal using vim.

Synchronized Painters:
A program that creates a series of synchorized painters with GUIs in swing, each with a name, a drawing panel, and a chat box. The series of painters connect to each other through a central hub and can be disconnected to run on their own. This was accomplisehed with a series of sockets and output streams to pass messages and shapes to the other painters and threads to split of processes like listening for updates from the other painters and writting updates to the other painters while running each individual painter and the hub. It was written with Java in Eclipse.
