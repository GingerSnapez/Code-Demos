Hi there! This is a description of three personal projects I have made in my free time in various ares of coding.

Strava Clone Group Project
A group project for my software design course, this consists of the following files: StravaT8_Facebook, StravaT8_Google, StravaT8_Server, StravaT8_Client and they must be activated in that order with an RMI registry running in order to view the final product. This project was made in a group where we created UML Diagrams and the like to plan out our project and then implemented our designs. It uses RMI, Sockets, and Spring Boot to connect the various servers and java swing for the GUI. The goal was to implement a series of patterns such as Controllers, Service Locators, Gateways, DTOs, Factories, Singletons, and more. The whole thing was syncronized using github, most of the code should be built with the ant files and the google should be build with the gradle file. **Adding SQL database**

Text_Huffman_Compression:
A program that uses a text file as a key to create a huffman compression program and then compress/decompress another given text file using bit maniputaltion and a huffman tree. This was written with C in the mac terminal using vim.

Synchronized Painters:
A program that creates a series of synchorized painters with GUIs in swing, each with a name, a drawing panel, and a chat box. The series of painters connect to each other through a central hub and can be disconnected to run on their own. This was accomplisehed with a series of sockets and output streams to pass messages and shapes to the other painters and threads to split of processes like listening for updates from the other painters and writting updates to the other painters while running each individual painter and the hub. It was written with Java in Eclipse.
